      <p>I'm a student at City of London, I' doing Msci Cyber Security. I made a little 
	game, it consists of bouncing balls and the user having to count them. It gets h	harder each level, visibility is harder, there's more balls and velocity will 
	increase a little bit...
	I am new to processing, I used to use python and was my main programming language 	up until Year 13.
	I don't really take pictures of myself that much so that one will do.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Bouncing Balls</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a little game that consists   	of bouncing balls and the user having to count them. It gets harder each level, 	visibility is harder, there's more balls and velocity will				increase a little bit. The user will either have to count them or guess, they will  	be given 3 options per level. The balls are in 3 arrays for the different 3 		levels: Easy, Medium and Hard. They are in a class but are called whenever the 		user chooses one of the options. Each level has their own background. My initial 	goal was to get the users input and compare it to the array length so the program	can validate if the answer is correct or not. However, I changed it last minute so 	the user can have 3 options and press a letter indicating the answer.
